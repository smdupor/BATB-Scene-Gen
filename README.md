# BATB-Scene-Gen
Proof of Concept / Working Alpha Build

This is a proof-of-concept for the larger project, X32 Scenerator. This project is designed to take input from a FileMaker Database built by a theatrical sound designer,
which includes all the information for the 75+ scene files, and output working scene files that can be loaded directly onto the Behringer X32 digital audio console 
(Version 3 for this proof of concept). Normally, these files must be programmed manually, on the hardware or Behringer's offline editor -- very time consuming. This 
software is intended to remove this manual step, saving users tens of hours of time and tedium per show build.

This is a proof-of-concept of the larger project, coded in BASH. This alpha build does work, and the files it generates have been used in a production environment 
successfully, but does not fully handle the programming steps we'd like to handle with the larger algorithm in Version 2.0, being coded in Java. Also, this version has many hard-coded values which will be more flexibly handled in the production version.

This software is no longer being updated, and has been replaced by the X32-Scenerator project on GitHub.
